# Mada-Bat-Morphology

This folder contains script and analyses and figures for Andrianiana and Andry et al. 2021, our Madagascar bat morphology paper. Analyses, scripts, and data for each figure are self-contained within the corresponding folder ("Fig1B-map", "Fig2", "Fig3", and "Fig4"), and the final figure files are stored in the folder, "final-figures". All scripts reference the central dataset "morph_paper_dat_7_23_2021.csv" which includes all compiled field data for this paper. Note that to run the script for Fig3, you will need to also clone the public repository, "[Mada-GIS](https://github.com/brooklabteam/Mada-GIS)", to your home computer and store within the same parent folder as this one.
