# Mada-Bat-Morphology

This folder contains script and analyses and figures for Andrianiaina and Andry et al. 2021, our Madagascar bat morphology paper, currently in review at the *Journal of Mammalogy*. Please see the preprint at XXX to view the paper early.

Analyses, scripts, and data for each figure are self-contained within the corresponding folder ("Fig1A", "Fig2", "Fig3", and "Fig4"), and the final figure files are stored in the folder, "final-figures". 

All scripts reference the central dataset "morph_paper_dat_7_23_2021.csv" which includes all compiled field data for this paper. 

Additionally, morphological traits queried in the literature are summarized in the csv file, "fruit-bat-morphology-literature.csv"; all references highlighted in this file are fully summarized and cited in *Journal of Mammalogy* reference format in the file "database_references.txt".

Note that to run the script for Fig3, you will need to also clone the public repository, "[Mada-GIS](https://github.com/brooklabteam/Mada-GIS)", to your home computer and store within the same parent folder as this one.
